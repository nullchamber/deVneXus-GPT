Sure, here are the exercises for Weeks 2 through 8 of the Artificial Intelligence and Data Science with Python course:

Week 2: Data Preprocessing and Cleaning

1. Load a dataset: Choose a dataset with missing values and/or outliers. Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame and display some basic statistics and information about the data.

2. Missing value imputation: Use Pandas or Scikit-Learn methods to impute missing values in the dataset. Compare different imputation techniques and their effects on the dataset.

3. Outlier detection and removal: Use Pandas or Scikit-Learn methods to detect and remove outliers from the dataset. Compare different outlier detection techniques and their effects on the dataset.

4. Feature scaling and normalization: Apply different feature scaling and normalization techniques to the dataset, such as Min-Max scaling, Z-score normalization, and log transformation. Compare the effects of these techniques on the dataset.

5. Data preprocessing pipeline: Build a data preprocessing pipeline using Scikit-Learn's Pipeline and ColumnTransformer classes. Use this pipeline to transform the raw dataset into a cleaned and preprocessed dataset suitable for machine learning.

6. Exploratory data analysis: Perform some exploratory data analysis on the preprocessed dataset to identify any patterns, trends, or outliers. Use visualizations, statistical measures, and domain knowledge to gain insights into the data.

7. Submit your notebook: Save your Jupyter Notebook and submit it to the course instructor or TA for feedback and grading. Make sure that the code is well-commented, organized, and properly formatted.

Week 3: Supervised Learning

1. Load a dataset: Choose a supervised learning dataset and split it into training and testing sets using Scikit-Learn's train_test_split function.

2. Linear regression: Implement linear regression using Scikit-Learn's LinearRegression class. Train the model on the training set and evaluate its performance on the testing set using metrics such as mean squared error and R-squared.

3. Logistic regression: Implement logistic regression using Scikit-Learn's LogisticRegression class. Train the model on the training set and evaluate its performance on the testing set using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

4. K-nearest neighbors: Implement k-nearest neighbors classification using Scikit-Learn's KNeighborsClassifier class. Choose an appropriate value for k and evaluate the model's performance on the testing set using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

5. Decision trees: Implement decision tree classification using Scikit-Learn's DecisionTreeClassifier class. Choose an appropriate value for the maximum depth and evaluate the model's performance on the testing set using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

6. Random forests: Implement random forest classification using Scikit-Learn's RandomForestClassifier class. Choose an appropriate value for the number of trees and evaluate the model's performance on the testing set using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

7. Submit your notebook: Save your Jupyter Notebook and submit it to the course instructor or TA for feedback and grading. Make sure that the code is well-commented, organized, and properly formatted.

Week 4: Unsupervised Learning

1. Load a dataset: Choose an unsupervised learning dataset and split it into training and testing sets using Scikit-Learn's train_test_split function.

2. K-means clustering: Implement k-means clustering using Scikit-Learn's KMeans class. Choose an appropriate value for k and evaluate the clustering performance using metrics such as silhouette score and inertia.

3. Hierarchical clustering: Implement hierarchical clustering using Scikit-Learn's AgglomerativeClustering class. Choose an appropriate linkage method and distance metric, and evaluate the
